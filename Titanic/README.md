# Titanic

## Introduction
This project is to investigate Titanic data, which contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. 

## What's included:
Code used to perform the analysis and a HTML file containing the analysis. This file includes:
* A note specifying which dataset you analyzed
* A statement of the question(s) you posed
* A description of what you did to investigate those questions
* Documentation of any data wrangling you did
* Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results
