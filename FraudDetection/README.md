# fraud_detection

## Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread 
corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the 
public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. This project utilized machine learning skills to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron
financial and email dataset.

## Items included:
