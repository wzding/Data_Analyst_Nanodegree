# Data Analyst Nanodegree
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree project files.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program which I started working from January 30, 2017 to March 20, 2017. The Data Analyst Nanodegree is an online certification intended to prepare students for a data science career. Students learn to use Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions.
